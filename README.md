# Homework-4_1-Ilan

The two changes I made to the original game are:

1. Gave the player 3 lives, each time he gets hit by an enemy he loses one life.

2. Each time the player gets hit by an enemy, aside from losing a life. He disapears for 3 seconds and spawns at the middle of the map with 3 seconds of invincibility so he can decide where to move next without instantly losing another life.

All the changes were made in the [GameOverOnTrigger2D](https://github.com/Tornifrog-Interactive/Homework-4_1-Ilan/blob/main/Assets/Scripts/GameOverOnTrigger2D.cs) file.
